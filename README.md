# learn-ansible
repository to test and learn about ansible !

Scenario — Suppose we have 100 servers, and we want to install nginx in all the servers at the same time. so how would we perform this task? I don’t think it’s convenient way to manually go to each server and install nginx one by one. so here Ansible comes in the picture. so now with the help of this amazing tool we can install nginx in all the 100 servers just by a single click. yes, you read it right, this is the magic of Ansible.
